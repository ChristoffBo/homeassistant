# Hassio Add-ons by petersendev: heimdall

## About

[Heimdall](https://heimdall.site/) is a way to organise all those links to your most used web sites and web applications in a simple way. Simplicity is the key to Heimdall. Why not use it as your browser start page? It even has the ability to include a search bar using either Google, Bing or DuckDuckGo.

This addon is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-heimdall) from linuxserver.io.
