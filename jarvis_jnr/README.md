# 🧩 Jarvis Jnr — Home Assistant Add-on  
This add-on runs a smart notification bot inside Home Assistant that connects to your **Gotify** server. Jarvis Jnr watches incoming messages, beautifies them into clean cards, reposts them, and can execute simple wake-word commands. It also enforces retention rules, supports integrations like **Radarr, Sonarr, Weather**, and includes a **toggleable Chat Personality** that posts random jokes, quips, or weird facts at controlled intervals.  

## What it is and what it is used for  
**Jarvis Jnr** is a Gotify-aware assistant. It listens to notifications in real time and can:  
- Beautify Radarr/Sonarr events into rich cards with posters, runtime, quality, etc.  
- Format JSON, YAML, Watchtower, and Semaphore payloads.  
- Auto-clean up Gotify feeds based on retention.  
- Respond to wake-word commands like `Jarvis help`, `Jarvis weather`, or `Jarvis series count`.  
- Optionally run in **personality mode**, dropping random jokes, puns, weird facts, or API-fetched quips to make the bot feel alive.  

Running Jarvis Jnr in **Home Assistant** makes sense if you already use Gotify for notifications. It centralizes formatting, command handling, and adds personality to your notifications.  

## Features  
- Beautifies incoming Gotify messages into clean cards.  
- Radarr event parsing → Poster, title, year, runtime, quality, size.  
- Sonarr event parsing → Poster, SxxEyy, title, runtime, quality, size.  
- Watchtower & Semaphore payloads → Labeled update reports.  
- JSON/YAML payloads → Parsed tables.  
- General messages → Generic card.  
- Retention cleanup → Purges Jarvis or non-Jarvis messages after configured hours.  
- Wake-word commands → Weather, Radarr, Sonarr, System help.  
- **Chat Personality** → Optional “weirdo mode” that posts random jokes, facts, or quotes at safe intervals.  
- **Extended Personality Modes** → Choose how Jarvis Jnr “speaks” by selecting a mood in `personality_mood`.  
- **AI Check-ins** → Optional automated status posts every 6h showing system heartbeat, enabled modules, and active mood.  
- **Configurable Cache Refresh** → Automatically refreshes Radarr/Sonarr caches at a set interval (default: 60 minutes).  

### Available Personality Modes  
- `sarcastic` → 😏 Snappy and ironic responses.  
  *Example:* “Oh, fantastic. Another system update. Exactly what I wanted.”

  *Example:* “ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ANOTHER ERROR?!”  
- `tired` → 😴 Slow, sleepy tone.  
  *Example:* “Yeah… fine… added the show… I need a nap now.”  
- `depressed` → 🌑 Dark, moody replies.  
  *Example:* “Another episode arrives… nothing ever changes.”

  *Example:* “YESSS! New content detected — let’s freaking GO!”

## Paths  
- **Config**: `/data/options.json` — add-on settings  
- **Bot core**: `/app/bot.py`  
- **Radarr/Sonarr**: `/app/arr.py`  
- **Weather module**: `/app/weather.py`  
- **Chat Personality**: `/app/chat.py`  
- **Personality state**: `/data/personality_state.json`  

## First-Time Setup (required)  
1. On your Gotify server, create:  
   - A **Client token** (for listening to WebSocket stream).  
   - An **App token** (for Jarvis to post replies).  
2. Place both tokens into the add-on’s options.  
3. Set URLs for Radarr/Sonarr if you want those modules active.  
4. Enable `personality_enabled` if you want the bot to post random jokes/facts.
