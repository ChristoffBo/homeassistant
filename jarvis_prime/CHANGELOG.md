## 1.1.4 (2025-09-04 19:00:00)
- Jarvis is now fully self-contained: all intakes (SMTP, Proxy, Webhook, Apprise) forward into /internal/emit
- Removed all hardcoded Gotify posting from sidecars â€” Jarvis is no longer dependent on Gotify as a server
- Centralized pipeline ensures all messages are beautified and riffed before any outputs
- Riffs now applied consistently across SMTP, Proxy, and Webhook modules
- Duplicate message issue resolved (no more double-post from sidecars)
- Boot screen updated to show Jarvis as standalone Notification Server
- Options.json simplified: output toggles (Gotify, ntfy, SMTP out, etc.) now only apply at Jarvis core
- **New:** Riffs explained â€” a "riff" is a short persona-driven remark or embellishment added to each message by Jarvisâ€™s LLM + Beautify engine.  
  Example: a plain "Backup complete" message becomes "ðŸ“¦ Backup complete â€” mission accomplished, Captain!" depending on the active persona.
