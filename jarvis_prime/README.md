# üß© Jarvis Prime ‚Äî Home Assistant Add-on

Jarvis Prime is a Unified Homelab Operations Platform

Jarvis Prime is your standalone Notification Orchestrator and Server. It centralizes, beautifies, and orchestrates notifications from across your homelab. Raw events come in through multiple intakes (SMTP, Proxy, Webhook, Apprise, Gotify, ntfy, WebSocket), are polished by the Beautify Engine, and are pushed back out through Gotify, ntfy, email, or its own sleek dark-mode Web UI. Every notification arrives consistent, enriched, and alive with personality. Jarvis now also includes a Chat lane: a pure chat channel into your local LLM (no riffs, no personas) that works alongside notifications when the LLM is enabled.
