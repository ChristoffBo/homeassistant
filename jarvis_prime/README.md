# üß© Jarvis Prime ‚Äî Home Assistant Add-on

Jarvis Prime is your standalone Notification Orchestrator, Chat Assistant, and Server. It centralizes, beautifies, and orchestrates notifications from across your homelab. Raw events come in through multiple intakes (SMTP, Proxy, Webhook, Apprise, Gotify, ntfy), are polished by the Beautify Engine, and are pushed back out through Gotify, ntfy, email, or its own sleek dark-mode Web UI. Every notification arrives consistent, enriched, and alive with personality. In addition, Jarvis now includes a dedicated Chat Lane ‚Äî ask questions or request explanations, and Jarvis will reply instantly using the local LLM. Chatting does not replace riffs; it gives you direct Q&A on demand.
