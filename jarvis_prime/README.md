üß© Jarvis Prime ‚Äî Home Assistant Add-on
Jarvis Prime is in deep ALPHA and work is ongoing
Jarvis Prime is your standalone Notification Orchestrator and Server. Now with real AI builtin. It is a fully flat, self-sufficient notification hub that runs inside Home Assistant. Jarvis Prime is not bound to Gotify ‚Äî it supports Gotify, ntfy, email, and includes its own web UI. This means you can centralize, beautify, and orchestrate all your notifications in one place. It listens to incoming messages, beautifies them into sleek AI-style cards, reposts them to your chosen outputs, and responds to wake-word commands like ‚ÄúJarvis weather‚Äù or ‚ÄúJarvis dns‚Äù. Jarvis Prime includes a seven-layer Beautify Engine, a LAN SMTP intake (Mailrise replacement), a lightweight HTTP proxy for Gotify/ntfy, and a full modern web UI. Every notification you throw at it arrives polished, consistent, and alive with personality.

What it is and what it does
Jarvis Prime is more than a bridge ‚Äî it is the core. A standalone Notification Orchestrator and Server that centralizes all formatting, command handling, and orchestration of messages across your home systems. It runs a seven-layer Beautify Engine to normalize, interpret, and render heterogeneous notifications into clean, unified AI-styled cards. It includes built-in wake-word command handling, live weather and DNS stats, ARR insights, and uptime checks. Jarvis Prime operates as your **home notification brain**, either fully standalone or integrated with Gotify, ntfy, and Home Assistant side by side.
