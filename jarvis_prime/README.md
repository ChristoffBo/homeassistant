# ðŸ§© Jarvis Prime â€” Home Assistant Add-on

**Jarvis Prime is a Unified Homelab Operations Platform**

Jarvis Prime is your standalone Notification Orchestrator, Automation Engine, Monitoring System, and Command Center. It centralizes, beautifies, and orchestrates notifications from across your homelab while providing powerful job scheduling, playbook execution, and real-time service monitoring capabilities. Raw events come in through multiple intakes (SMTP, Proxy, Webhook, Apprise, Gotify, ntfy, WebSocket), are polished by the Beautify Engine, and are pushed back out through Gotify, ntfy, email, or its own sleek dark-mode Web UI. Every notification arrives consistent, enriched, and alive with personality. Jarvis now also includes a Chat lane: a pure chat channel into your local LLM (no riffs, no personas) that works alongside notifications when the LLM is enabled.

## Features

## Self-Hosting Statement

Jarvis Prime is fully self-contained. Gotify, ntfy, and WebSocket are optional â€” use them only if you want push or persistent WS. The add-on runs standalone with its own intakes, Beautify Engine, personas, Chat lane, Orchestration engine, Analytics monitoring, and dark-mode UI. All functionality works offline without external dependencies.
