üß© Jarvis Prime ‚Äî Home Assistant Add-on
Jarvis Prime is a Unified Homelab Operations Platform

Jarvis Prime is your standalone Notification Orchestrator, Automation Engine, Monitoring System, and Command Center. It centralizes, beautifies, and orchestrates notifications from across your homelab while providing powerful job scheduling, playbook execution, and real-time service monitoring capabilities. Raw events come in through multiple intakes (SMTP, Proxy, Webhook, Apprise, Gotify, ntfy, WebSocket), are polished by the Beautify Engine, and are pushed back out through Gotify, ntfy, email, or its own sleek dark-mode Web UI. Every notification arrives consistent, enriched, and alive with personality. Jarvis now also includes a Chat lane: a pure chat channel into your local LLM (no riffs, no personas) that works alongside notifications when the LLM is enabled.

Jarvis Prime now includes a built-in authentication system that protects both the Web UI and API. On first startup, an Initial Setup overlay appears prompting you to create a username and password. Credentials are stored securely in /data/users.json with full encryption and password hashing. Once logged in, your session remains active for one hour of inactivity before automatically logging out for security. If the credentials file is deleted, Jarvis automatically recreates a default admin account on the next startup.

‚Ä¢ Incident History: Track downtime incidents with duration and error details
‚Ä¢ Visual Dashboard: Service status cards showing current state, uptime %, avg response time
‚Ä¢ Retries ‚Äì Each service must fail a configurable number of consecutive checks before being marked DOWN, filtering out temporary timeouts or network hiccups
‚Ä¢ Flap Window ‚Äì Defines the time window (in seconds) used to detect service instability; older state changes automatically expire outside this period
‚Ä¢ Flap Threshold ‚Äì Sets how many up/down flips are allowed within the flap window before the service is considered ‚Äúflapping‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Suppression Duration ‚Äì When flapping exceeds the threshold, alerts for that service are automatically muted for a defined duration while metrics continue to be recorded
‚Ä¢ Flap Tracking & Recovery ‚Äì The system tracks every state change, applies suppression intelligently, and resumes normal alerting once the suppression window ends
‚Ä¢ Result ‚Äì Clean, noise-free uptime data with zero false positives ‚Äî enterprise-grade stability built in
‚Ä¢ Network Intelligence ‚Äì Adds local network scanning and device awareness. Jarvis discovers active devices on your LAN via ARP/IP, recording MAC, IP, vendor, and hostname. Newly seen devices trigger notifications; monitored ones are tracked for uptime. Promote any device to an Analytics service with one click for automated ping checks
‚Ä¢ Continuous Scanning ‚Äì Background scans run automatically at intervals and handle retries gracefully
‚Ä¢ Offline Detection ‚Äì Monitored devices are flagged if not seen for a defined period

Trend analysis detects degradations or recoveries, with optional Gotify/ntfy alerts. Results charted in Analytics with full purge options. Interval is user-adjustable. All data persisted in SQLite

üó∫Ô∏è Atlas ‚Äî Network Topology Visualization (New)
Atlas provides a live, interactive topology map of your entire homelab infrastructure ‚Äî visually linking all hosts and services discovered by Orchestrator and Analytics. It renders using an offline local copy of D3.js, so it works entirely without internet access.
How Atlas Works
‚Ä¢ Reads live topology data from /api/atlas/topology
‚Ä¢ Merges host data from Orchestrator and service data from Analytics
‚Ä¢ Displays nodes (hosts, services, core) with color-coded status
‚Ä¢ Zoom and pan supported (mouse, touch, mobile-friendly)
‚Ä¢ Tooltips show IPs, groups, latency, and current state
‚Ä¢ Auto-refresh every 10 seconds when Atlas tab is active
‚Ä¢ Works fully offline
Legend
‚Ä¢ üü¢ Green ‚Üí Service/Host healthy (up)
‚Ä¢ ‚ö™ Gray ‚Üí Host detected but inactive or unreachable
‚Ä¢ üîµ Blue core ‚Üí Central Jarvis Prime node
Access
‚Ä¢ Open the Atlas tab in the Web UI (/ui/index.html)
‚Ä¢ Uses the same dark theme as the rest of Jarvis Prime
‚Ä¢ No configuration required ‚Äî data is auto-generated

üõ°Ô∏è Sentinel ‚Äî Self-Healing Monitoring Engine (Alpha Testing)
Sentinel is the autonomous self-healing subsystem. It runs scheduled checks, performs automatic repairs, and tracks every action in a live dashboard.
How Sentinel Works
‚Ä¢ Sentinel monitors only what you configure (manual opt-in)
Add Servers (Servers Tab)
‚Ä¢ Add each SSH-enabled server with hostname/IP, port, and credentials
Templates (Templates Tab)
‚Ä¢ Templates define how to check, repair, and verify services
‚Ä¢ Pre-configured templates include Docker, Plex, Nginx, MySQL, Disk Usage, etc.
‚Ä¢ You can create or upload custom templates
Configure Monitoring (Monitoring Tab)
‚Ä¢ Assign templates per server (e.g., Media Server: Plex + Docker + Disk Usage)
Scheduling
‚Ä¢ Each check runs at your defined interval (default 300 s) with retries before escalation
What Sentinel Does
‚Ä¢ Executes checks via SSH on schedule
‚Ä¢ Runs automated repair commands on failures
‚Ä¢ Verifies results, logs outcomes, and maintains full execution history
‚Ä¢ Integrates with Jarvis notifications for alerts/summaries
Smart Features
‚Ä¢ Retry Logic, Escalation, Quiet Hours, Maintenance Windows, Flap Detection
‚Ä¢ Dashboard metrics: uptime %, failed repairs, total checks
Sentinel Template Deduplication
‚Ä¢ Templates are loaded from two locations:
  /app/sentinel_templates (GitHub defaults)
  /share/jarvis_prime/sentinel/custom_templates (Local overrides)
‚Ä¢ If same id+name exists in both, the GitHub version is kept

üß© Backup Module ‚Äî Agentless Backup & Restore Engine (New)
The Backup Module provides full agentless backup and restore across your infrastructure using SSH, SMB, and NFS. It replaces duplicati-style tools with a transparent, verifiable system integrated into Jarvis Prime.
What It Does
‚Ä¢ Creates compressed archives (tar.gz) or streams disk images (dd over SSH)
‚Ä¢ Stores per-job metadata: start/end time, duration, size, checksum, status
‚Ä¢ Sends fan-out notifications to Gotify/ntfy/UI with job summaries and errors
‚Ä¢ Runs asynchronously in its own process ‚Äî no UI blocking
‚Ä¢ Offers a UI file explorer to browse remote hosts and archives
‚Ä¢ Supports restore to original location or a new path/host
‚Ä¢ Supports cloud/NAS restores via the same protocol used to store backups
How It Works
‚Ä¢ Define jobs with:
  - name, source paths (local or remote via SSH), destination path (local/NAS/SMB/NFS/cloud mount)
  - schedule (cron), retention policy, compression (on/off), exclude patterns, bandwidth limits
‚Ä¢ For file backups: archives are tar.gz with stable, timestamped names
‚Ä¢ For disk images: dd over SSH writes to destination with progress and integrity checks
‚Ä¢ Retention: per-job pruning keeps last N or age-based windows while protecting most-recent success
‚Ä¢ Restore Mode:
  - File restore: choose archive ‚Üí target host/path ‚Üí original or new location ‚Üí restore
  - Image restore: pick image ‚Üí target block device over SSH ‚Üí streamed write with confirmation
‚Ä¢ Import Existing Backups: point to a directory to index and manage prior archives in the UI
‚Ä¢ Safety:
  - Dry-run previews file lists for file backups
  - Confirmations for destructive image writes
  - Disk size and device guardrails for dd restores
‚Ä¢ All operations log to SQLite and surface in the UI with status, duration, and size
Result
‚Ä¢ A fully self-contained, agentless backup system with visual management, multi-protocol support, restore automation, and real-time notifications ‚Äî no external dependencies required

Chat & Intelligence
‚Ä¢ Chat Lane: pure LLM chat (no riffs/personas), available via Gotify, ntfy, or Web UI when LLM is enabled
‚Ä¢ RAG Integration: if you set a long lived token and your Home Assistant URL, chat can answer questions about your systems

Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
‚Ä¢ Installable web app with offline caching and push capabilities (requires HTTPS)

Supported Sources
‚Ä¢ Radarr / Sonarr, QNAP, Unraid, Watchtower, Speedtest, Technitium DNS, Weather, Uptime Kuma, JSON/YAML, Email, Gotify, ntfy, Webhooks, Apprise, WebSocket, plain text, Chat
