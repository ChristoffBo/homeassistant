# ðŸ§© Jarvis Prime â€” Home Assistant Add-on

**Jarvis Prime is a Unified Homelab Operations Platform**

Jarvis Prime is your standalone Notification Orchestrator, Automation Engine, and Command Center. It centralizes, beautifies, and orchestrates notifications from across your homelab while providing powerful job scheduling and playbook execution capabilities. Raw events come in through multiple intakes (SMTP, Proxy, Webhook, Apprise, Gotify, ntfy, WebSocket), are polished by the Beautify Engine, and are pushed back out through Gotify, ntfy, email, or its own sleek dark-mode Web UI. Every notification arrives consistent, enriched, and alive with personality. Jarvis now also includes a Chat lane: a pure chat channel into your local LLM (no riffs, no personas) that works alongside notifications when the LLM is enabled.

## Features

## Intake Setup Details

### 1. SMTP Intake (Mailrise replacement)
â€¢ Start Jarvis Prime and note the SMTP port (default 2525)  
â€¢ In your app (Duplicati, Proxmox, etc.), set SMTP server to 10.0.0.100 and port 2525  
â€¢ Authentication: any username/password (ignored)  
â€¢ Subject = Jarvis Card title, body = Card body  
â€¢ Example: configure Duplicati â†’ Notifications â†’ SMTP â†’ server=10.0.0.100, port=2525  

### 2. Webhook Intake
â€¢ URL: http://10.0.0.100:2590/webhook  
â€¢ Accepts plain text or JSON  
â€¢ Example plain text:  
```bash
curl -X POST http://10.0.0.100:2590/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d 'Backup finished'
```
â€¢ Example JSON:  
```bash
curl -X POST http://10.0.0.100:2590/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Backup Complete","message":"Node 1 finished","priority":7}'
```

### 3. Apprise Intake
â€¢ URL: http://10.0.0.100:2591/intake/apprise/notify?token=YOUR_LONG_TOKEN

4. View, delete, or execute playbooks from the playbook list

### Running Jobs
**Manual Execution:**
1. Select a playbook from the list
2. Choose target server or server group
3. Click **Run Now** to execute immediately
4. Watch live logs stream in real-time via WebSocket

**Scheduled Execution:**
1. Click **Schedule Job** on any playbook
2. Provide a schedule name and description

4. Choose specific time/day as needed
5. Select target server or group

7. Schedules run automatically in the background

### Job History
â€¢ View all past executions with status (success/failed/running)
â€¢ Filter by playbook or status
â€¢ Review full execution logs for troubleshooting
â€¢ Track execution duration and timestamps
â€¢ Purge old history by criteria (all, failed, completed, older than 30/90 days)

## Web UI Access

â€¢ Ingress via Home Assistant â†’ Add-on â†’ Jarvis Prime â†’ OPEN WEB UI  
â€¢ Or direct browser: http://10.0.0.100:PORT  
â€¢ **Inbox** tab: shows beautified cards with filters, retention, purge, and live updates

## Self-Hosting Statement

Jarvis Prime is fully self-contained. Gotify, ntfy, and WebSocket are optional â€” use them only if you want push or persistent WS. The add-on runs standalone with its own intakes, Beautify Engine, personas, Chat lane, Orchestration engine, and dark-mode UI. All functionality works offline without external dependencies.
