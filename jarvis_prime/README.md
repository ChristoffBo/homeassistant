# ðŸ§© Jarvis Prime â€” Home Assistant Add-on

Jarvis Prime is your standalone Notification Orchestrator and Server. It can run fully self-contained, or side-by-side with Gotify or ntfy for mobile review. It centralizes, beautifies, and orchestrates notifications from across your homelab, turning raw events into sleek, unified cards with personality. Jarvis listens to multiple intakes (SMTP, Proxy, Webhook, Apprise, Gotify, ntfy), rewrites and beautifies messages, and pushes them back out through Gotify, ntfy, email, or its own dark-mode web UI.

Jarvis is not just a bridge â€” it is the core. It centralizes formatting, command handling, and orchestration of messages across your home systems. Every notification you throw at it arrives polished, consistent, and alive with personality.
