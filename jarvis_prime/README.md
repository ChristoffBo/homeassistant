# üß© Jarvis Prime ‚Äî Home Assistant Add-on

**Jarvis Prime is a Unified Homelab Operations Platform**

Jarvis Prime is your standalone Notification Orchestrator, Automation Engine, Monitoring System, and Command Center. It centralizes, beautifies, and orchestrates notifications from across your homelab while providing powerful job scheduling, playbook execution, and real-time service monitoring capabilities. Raw events come in through multiple intakes (SMTP, Proxy, Webhook, Apprise, Gotify, ntfy, WebSocket), are polished by the Beautify Engine, and are pushed back out through Gotify, ntfy, email, or its own sleek dark-mode Web UI. Every notification arrives consistent, enriched, and alive with personality. Jarvis now also includes a Chat lane: a pure chat channel into your local LLM (no riffs, no personas) that works alongside notifications when the LLM is enabled.

## Features

### Notification System

### Orchestration & Automation
‚Ä¢ **Job Orchestration**: Run playbooks, scripts, and commands across your infrastructure  
‚Ä¢ **Playbook Management**: Upload and organize Ansible playbooks, shell scripts, and Python scripts  
‚Ä¢ **Server Inventory**: Manage SSH-enabled servers with groups and descriptions  
‚Ä¢ **Scheduling**: Cron-based job scheduling with flexible timing (every 5 minutes to yearly)  
‚Ä¢ **Live Execution Logs**: Real-time WebSocket streaming of job output  
‚Ä¢ **Job History**: Track all executions with status, duration, and full logs  
‚Ä¢ **Manual Execution**: Run any playbook on-demand against any server or group  
‚Ä¢ **Notification Integration**: Optional notifications on job completion (can be disabled for frequent jobs)  
‚Ä¢ **Multi-Runner Support**: Execute Ansible playbooks (.yml), shell scripts (.sh), or Python scripts (.py)  

### Analytics & Monitoring
‚Ä¢ **Service Health Monitoring**: Real-time HTTP, TCP, and ICMP Ping endpoint checks  
‚Ä¢ **Uptime Tracking**: 24-hour uptime percentage and response time metrics  
‚Ä¢ **Incident Detection**: Automatic incident creation when services go down  
‚Ä¢ **Health Score Dashboard**: Overall homelab health percentage with visual status cards  
‚Ä¢ **Service Management**: Add, edit, enable/disable services via Web UI  
‚Ä¢ **Configurable Checks**: Set custom intervals, timeouts, and expected status codes  
‚Ä¢ **Multi-Protocol Support**: Monitor HTTP endpoints (with status code validation), TCP ports, or ICMP Ping hosts  
‚Ä¢ **Incident History**: Track downtime incidents with duration and error details  
‚Ä¢ **Visual Dashboard**: Service status cards showing current state, uptime %, avg response time  

### Advanced Reliability Logic (Anti-Flap & Retries)
‚Ä¢ **Retries** ‚Äì Each service must fail a configurable number of consecutive checks before being marked **DOWN**, filtering out temporary timeouts or network hiccups.  
‚Ä¢ **Flap Window** ‚Äì Defines the time window (in seconds) used to detect service instability; older state changes automatically expire outside this period.  
‚Ä¢ **Flap Threshold** ‚Äì Sets how many up/down flips are allowed within the flap window before the service is considered ‚Äúflapping.‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ **Suppression Duration** ‚Äì When flapping exceeds the threshold, alerts for that service are automatically muted for a defined duration while metrics continue to be recorded.  
‚Ä¢ **Flap Tracking & Recovery** ‚Äì The system tracks every state change, applies suppression intelligently, and resumes normal alerting once the suppression window ends.  
‚Ä¢ **Result:** clean, noise-free uptime data with zero false positives ‚Äî enterprise-grade stability built in.  

### Chat & Intelligence
‚Ä¢ Chat Lane: pure LLM chat (no riff/persona), works via Gotify, ntfy, or Web UI when LLM is enabled  
‚Ä¢ RAG Integration: if you have set a long lived token and your Home Assistant URL, chat will now answer questions regarding your systems  

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Jarvis Prime includes support for installation as a Progressive Web App (PWA). This allows you to add Jarvis directly to your home screen or desktop and run it like a native application with its own window and icon. The PWA includes offline caching, automatic updates via service worker, and notification support.  
**Setup Instructions:**  
1. Ensure Jarvis is served over **HTTPS** (via Home Assistant Ingress or a reverse proxy with a valid certificate).  
2. Confirm that the included `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js` are being served from the Jarvis web root.  
3. Open Jarvis in Chrome/Edge/Android/iOS Safari. You should see an ‚ÄúInstall App‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdd to Home Screen‚Äù option.  
4. After installation, Jarvis runs as a standalone app with its own icon (using `logo.png`).  
**Benefits:**  
‚Ä¢ Secure HTTPS app-like access from any device  
‚Ä¢ One-click launch with persistent login  
‚Ä¢ Offline fallback support via caching  
‚Ä¢ Automatic background updates  
‚Ä¢ Push notification support for future expansion

## LLM Best Practices & Tested Settings
Jarvis Prime supports Phi-3.5, Phi-4 Q4, Q5, Q6, Q8 for chat, riffs, and message beautification. These settings balance **performance, coherence, memory use, and response length**.

### Recommended Settings by Model
| Model       | Context Window (CTX) | Riff Max Tokens | Riff Cutoff Tokens | Message Rewrite Max Tokens | Notes |
|------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------|
| Phi-3.5    | 4,096              | 50             | 45              | 45                        | Lightweight, good for smaller systems; less context retention. |
| Phi-4 Q4   | 8,000              | 55             | 50              | 50                        | Better context than 3.5; slightly slower on CPU. |
| Phi-4 Q5   | 12,000             | 60             | 55              | 50                        | Recommended sweet spot: fast, coherent, large context. |
| Phi-4 Q6   | 12,000             | 60             | 55              | 50                        | Slightly higher memory usage than Q5; similar output quality. |
| Phi-4 Q8   | 12,000             | 60             | 55              | 50                        | Highest memory usage; may slow on low-resource systems. |

### What Each Setting Does
- **Context Window (CTX)**: Number of prior tokens the model ‚Äúremembers‚Äù; larger CTX preserves more conversation/notification history.  
- **Riff Max Tokens**: Maximum tokens for generated riffs; model stops naturally if fewer are needed.  
- **Cutoff Tokens**: Optional buffer to avoid mid-thought truncation.  
- **Message Rewrite Max Tokens**: Limits length of rewrites; ensures concise, polished output.  

### Middle-Ground Recommendation
For most users on moderate hardware:  
- **Model**: Phi-4 Q5  
- **CTX**: 12,000  
- **Riff Max Tokens**: 60  
- **Cutoff Tokens**: 55  
- **Message Rewrite Max Tokens**: 50  

This combination provides **good performance, coherent responses, and avoids excessive CPU/memory use**.
