Home Assistant Add-on Updater

Created by ChristoffBo with help from ChatGPT and Deepseek AI.

This add-on automatically checks and updates Docker image versions used in your custom Home Assistant add-ons. It compares the current image version with the latest available from Docker Hub, LinuxServer.io, or GitHub Container Registry and updates your add-on metadata if needed.
