🧩 Veil (Experimental)

⚠️ Veil is an experimental privacy-first DNS/DHCP system — some features are not yet active or still under development. Designed as a self-hosted stealth resolver, it provides encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT/DoQ), DNSSEC validation, 🧩 Veil — Privacy-First DNS/DHCP Server A complete standalone DNS and DHCP service designed for privacy, resilience, and full control. Veil implements encrypted DNS (DoH, DoT, DoQ), DNSSEC validation, RFC-compliant padding and QNAME minimization, SafeSearch enforcement, rate limiting, caching, and auto-updating blocklists with zero telemetry. It runs entirely locally and includes a complete DHCPv4 stack with static and dynamic leases, PXE/TFTP options, and relay support. ✅ Features • Full recursive DNS resolver with Cloudflare/Google/Quad9 upstreams • DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-QUIC (RFC 9250) • DNSSEC trust-anchor validation and per-record signature checks • RFC 7830/8467 query padding and 0x20 case randomization • QNAME minimization (RFC 9156) and EDNS Client Subnet stripping • Rate limiting per client (token bucket), query jitter, and parallel upstream rotation • SafeSearch rewrites for Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, YouTube • Local blocklist/blacklist/whitelist with JSON persistence and daily auto-updates • Conditional forwarding, local rewrites, and static records • Negative caching, stale cache serving, and cache pre-warming with top domains • Full DHCPv4 server: DISCOVER/OFFER/REQUEST/ACK/NAK/DECLINE/RELEASE/INFORM • Ping-before-offer conflict detection, static leases, PXE boot, vendor options, relay support • REST API for stats, blocklist, DHCP lease and rewrite management • Zero telemetry: all processing, logs, and storage are fully local 📁 Files veil.py (main server) • ui/ (Web UI) • config.json • Dockerfile 🌍 Web UI Accessible at http://<host-ip>:8080 after launch; shows live DNS/DHCP statistics, blocklist status, and allows uploads or edits directly from the browser. 🧠 Summary Veil replaces AdGuard Home or Technitium with a single-binary, zero-telemetry privacy firewall for DNS and DHCP. Every query is encrypted, padded, randomized, and optionally DNSSEC-validated. Caching, SafeSearch, and blocklists are handled locally; no external analytics or data leaves your network. Fully self-hosted.
